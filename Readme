Bugfixes (http://arclanguage.org/item?id=10830, each on tables returns nil)
Case can work on lists and other compounds

Generic functions that read from vtables* and dispatch on the type of the _last_ arg.
There are 4 refinements regarding what to do when there's no entry in vtables*
  defgeneric: coerce last arg to cons
  defgeneric*: coerce _all_ args to cons
  deftransform: coerce last arg to cons, coerce back to its original type afterward
  deftransform*: coerce all args to cons, coerce back to original type afterward
  (Previous discussions: http://arclanguage.org/item?id=11779, http://arclanguage.org/item?id=11865)

some, all, mem, trues, keep, rem, len, iso are now all generic.

- Incompatibilities
1. nil == (); type.nil == nil.
  Coerce () 'cons returns () which is not a cons. Can cause infinite loops in defgeneric.
2. some and keep don't testify.
